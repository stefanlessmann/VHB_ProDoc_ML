We will continue working with the credit risk analytics case, and benchmark alternative supervised learning algorithms to default prediction. In this scope, we will revisit data organization principles, classification model evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning. The notebook concludes with an outlook on the XAI (explainable AI lecture) by illustrating some standard XAI outputs to shed light on the patterns inferred by our learning algorithms. \n",

For algorithms that exhibit hyperparameters, make sure these are properly tuned. Assess the performance of the different algorithms in terms of i) the area under the ROC curve, ii) the area under the prediction-recall curve, iii) the F-score, and iv) the Brier score (i.e., the mean squared error of the predicted probabilities compared to a zero-one coded target). Produce an estimate of model performance for each algorithm on a suitably selected subset of the development data. Also assess models on the holdout data (i.e., `dfHoldout`). Plot the ROC-curve, the PR-curve, and the confusion matrix for logistic regression and the overall best-performing model (if different) on the holdout sample.  "
