# VHB-ProDok Course Machine Learning

VHB-ProDok is a format offered by the German Academic Association for Business Research to support doctorates in business studies in German-speaking countries. Detailed information concerning the program and the more than 40 courses it offers are available at the [VHB-ProDok homepage](https://www.vhbonline.org/en/events/prodok).

The repository targets participants of the ProDoc course Machine Learning, offered within the ProDok program. Please refer to the [course overview](https://www.vhbonline.org/veranstaltungen/prodok) for detailed information on the format and content of this course and other ProDok offers.

The repository provides materials for the coding sessions of the Machine Learning course, including Jupyter notebooks and datasets. 

If you are new to Python programming, I suggest you explore [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com), which is a free online coding environment. Many tutorials about Colab are available on the web (see, e.g., [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/google_colab/index.htm)) and will help you to get started. The advantage of Colab is that you do not need to install any software to your local machine.

If you prefer using your own computer, you can certainly do so. All you need is freely available on the web. The [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/?gclid=CjwKCAiAhc7yBRAdEiwAplGxX_cnNEcik0eYiYjlORTq7c_4xA3gOhqFc0v-8pwNw5vC6ADTKwuFRhoC-98QAvD_BwE) of Python is the most popular choice for data scientists and includes everything you need to get started. Regarding code editing, we will make use of Jupyter notebooks during the course. However, many other great code editors exist, including  [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), and others. You are free to use any of them. 

Needless to say, AI is very *knowledgeable* in all these topics. If you have any questions regarding the technical setup, feels somewhat unsure about the mentioned options, etc. just have a chat with your favorite LLM and it will happily provide qualified (most likely) advise. That being said, you are also welcome to contact me by mail with any questions concerning the course 😉. 


**Happy coding and look forward to meeting you in the VHB ProDok course on Machine Learning**
