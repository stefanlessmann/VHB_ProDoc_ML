# VHB-ProDok Course Machine Learning

VHB-ProDok is a format offered by the German Academic Association for Business Research to support doctorates in business studies in German-speaking countries. Detailed information concerning the program and the more 40 courses it offers are available at the [VHB-ProDok homepage](https://www.vhbonline.org/en/events/prodok).

The repository targets participants of the course Machine Learning, which I will offer anually or bi-annually from 2020 onwards. Please refer to the [course's homepage](https://www.vhbonline.org/en/veranstaltungen/prodok/kurse-2020/translate-to-englisch-2004ms01) for detailed information on the format and content of the course.

For now, the repository comprises the files of the pre-course mini-assignment, which enables participants to familiarize themselves with the Python programming language and revisit their abilities in descriptive statistics and multivariate statistical analysis. Detailed solutions to the tasks will be provided during the course, 06. to 09. April, 2020 in Berlin.
