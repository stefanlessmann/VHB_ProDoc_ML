The plot should ideally show a random scatter of points around the horizontal line at zero, without any discernible pattern. A funnel shape (i.e., increasing or decreasing spread of residuals) may indicate heteroscedasticity, while a systematic pattern (e.g., a curve) may suggest nonlinearity.\n",

Deviations from this line may indicate non-normality, which can affect inference in linear regression.\n",
